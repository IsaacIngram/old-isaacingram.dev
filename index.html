    <h1 id="aboutMeSectionTitle">Some Random Things About Me</h1>

    <h2 class="aboutMeTitle"><a class="link" href="https://github.com/IsaacIngram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">I like to code stuff</a></h2>
    <p class="aboutMeDescription">Everything about programming interests me, so I make a lot of random things. I made this website, various Discord bots, and I am currently working on making my garage door HomeKit compatible. I am the head programmer for my FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Competition teams, and I also have recently worked on a website to help my friend start his car detailing business.</p>

    <h2 class="aboutMeTitle"><a class="link" href="https://fellowproducts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">I drink too much coffee</a></h2>
    <p class="aboutMeDescription">I bought my first coffee maker in 6th grade (how did my parents allow that?), but I have recently become more interested in brewing quality coffee. I like to purchase locally roasted beans, and my favorite brewing method currently is a <a class="link" href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/clara-french-press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Clara French Press</a>. My caffeine intake has also gone through the roof since I started working at a particularly green and well known coffee chain, which is why I created this website at 1AM on a Thursday.</p>

    <h2 class="aboutMeTitle"><a class="link" href="https://music.apple.com/profile/isaacingram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDM is amazing</a></h2>
    <p class="aboutMeDescription">EDM has been my favorite music genre for as long as I can remember. Some of my favorite artists are Deadmau5, Alan Walker, and Porter Robinson.</p>

    <h2 class="aboutMeTitle"><a class="link" href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">I really like clicky keyboards</a></h2>
    <p class="aboutMeDescription">Mechanical keyboards make typing code and wasting time on Discord very enjoyable. My keyboard is currently a <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/gmmk-tkl-tenkeyless-brown-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link">Glorious GMMK TKL</a> with <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/switches/products/novelkeys-x-kailh-box-pinks" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link">Kailh BOX Pink</a> switches and <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.gskill.com/product/341/342/1602504434/Crystal-Crown-Keycaps,-Black-Overview">G-Skill Crystal Crown</a> keycaps. I participated in the <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/products/gmk-metropolis-r2-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link">GMK Metropolis R2 Group Buy</a>, although I won't receieve my order until sometime in 2022 :(</p>
